## **TYPE INTO THE VOID – Now with a GUI\!**

Void Scribe offers a unique approach to private note-taking. Originally a command-line editor where your keystrokes remain unseen, it now features a **Notepad-like Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, giving you flexible options for concealing your thoughts. All your hidden notes are securely saved upon interruption (terminal) or explicit action (GUI), ready for future reference.

## **Features**

* **Modular Design:** Core functionalities are separated for improved maintainability and extensibility.  
* **Dual Interface:** Choose between the classic **Command-line Interface** with hidden text or the new **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for a more traditional text editor experience.  
* **Enhanced Password Protection & Encryption:** Utilizes **AES-256 GCM** encryption with a robust **PBKDF2HMAC** Key Derivation Function (KDF) to securely derive cryptographic keys from your password, significantly improving resistance against brute-force attacks.  
* **Remote Sending:** Option to send the saved file to a remote SSH server (terminal version only).  
* **Auto-Deletion of Local Copy:** Option to delete the local file after saving (and sending if enabled).

## **Installation**

Before running Void Scribe, ensure you have Python 3 and the cryptography library installed.

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files.**  
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**  
   cd void\_scribe\_project/

3. **Install dependencies:**  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

## **Usage**

The project is structured into three main components and a core library:

* void\_core.py: Contains the shared core logic for encryption, decryption, and file handling.  
* void\_scribe\_terminal.py: The original command-line editor.  
* void\_scribe\_gui.py: The new graphical notepad-like editor.  
* void\_key.py: A utility for decrypting .enc files.

### **1\. Invisible Writing (Terminal Version)**

Use void\_scribe\_terminal.py for the original hidden typing experience. Interrupt with Ctrl+C to save your content.

python void\_scribe\_terminal.py \--help

**Example: Encrypt, Save, Send, and Delete**

python void\_scribe\_terminal.py \--encrypt \--send \--server your\_ssh\_server.com \--remote-path /path/to/remote/dir/ \--delete-local \--verbose

### **2\. GUI Notepad Experience**

Use void\_scribe\_gui.py to open the graphical text editor.

python void\_scribe\_gui.py

Within the GUI:

* Type your notes in the text area.  
* Click "Encrypt & Save" to encrypt your content and choose a file location.  
* Click "Decrypt & Open" to select an encrypted file, decrypt it, and display its content in the editor.  
* Click "Clear All" to clear the current text from the editor.

### **3\. Decrypting Encrypted Files**

Use void\_key.py to decrypt files generated by either void\_scribe\_terminal.py or void\_scribe\_gui.py.

python void\_key.py \--help

**Example: Decrypt a file**

python void\_key.py scripture\_20231027\_153045.enc

You will be prompted to enter the decryption password interactively.

## **Software Engineering Considerations**

This iteration of Void Scribe incorporates key software engineering principles:

* **Separation of Concerns:** Core functionalities (encryption, decryption, file I/O) have been moved to void\_core.py, making them reusable and independent of the user interface. This enhances modularity and makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.  
* **Improved Security:** The switch from simple SHA-256 hashing to **PBKDF2HMAC** for key derivation is a critical security enhancement. PBKDF2HMAC adds a significant computational cost (via iterations) and uses a unique, random salt for each encryption, making brute-force and rainbow table attacks far more difficult and computationally expensive for an attacker.  
* **Extensibility:** The modular design allows for easier integration of future features or alternative interfaces without impacting the core logic.  
* **User Flexibility:** Providing both a terminal and a GUI option caters to different user preferences and workflows.
